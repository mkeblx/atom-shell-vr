# Atom Shell VR

Native packaging for VR web apps

## Why?

All the same reasons you would use [Atom shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) for distribution combined with the current need to use a plugin for accessing the VR headset data, which is more easily incorporated into one distribution that works out of the box.

In addition can provide a starting setup that is well suited to a VR application.

## Future

-Switch to a non-plugin based approach as the underlying Chromium is phasing out NPAPI plugin support
-Abandon project when native browser support for HMDs comes, and VR web distribution platforms appear (likely not far off)
